title: Pearls Of Computer Science
date: 210901
---

This module covers a bit of everything - everyone learns something new.

8 pearls:
 - black: computer architecutre
 - blue: algorythgms
 - green: databases
 - cyan: functional programming
 - red: cryptography
 - magenta: networks & OSs
 - yellow: intelligent interations
 - white: requiremts engineering

These pears will be accompanied by academic skills & math.

There will be a project at the end. 

Every pearl is teached by a different teacher. 
Module coordinators will be present throut the whole modue. (eemcs@utwnte.nl)

There will be 80 teaching assistants (TAs), who will help the 400+ students. You can become TA next year, if you score 8.5+.

Who to ask:
 - Only contact module coordinator if you have a problem with the module as a whole.
 - With great personal matters (a lot of absence) contact the teaching advisor.
 - Small personal metters (more than one day of absence) can be hadeled by housemaster.
 - If you don't understand the material, ask the teacher during lecture or Q&A.
 - With technical problems and excercise issues approach TAs.

The math part is completly seperate.

Academic skills is part of PCS canvas page and runs through more modules.

Module guide is the main reading material. A new chapter will be published every week. Always read it before asking questinos!

Some excercies need to be singed-off by a TA. Some assignments need to be submitted (uploaded to canvas). The pearl assignment can give you a bonus point. 

	your pearl greade = test grade + bonus point
You need to hit 5.5 on your project to pass. You need all tests to be above 5.0, all but two at 5.5 or higher and the weighted avarage to be 5.5 or higer to pass the module. 

You can retake up to 3 tests and remake excercieses during week 10. 

You may never publish or share your code with anyone. Talking about assignments is fine, but never send code!

In a processor, elements (memorry, adders, multipliers...) are made out of logic gates (transistors).
If we have a cuircit with multiple arithmetic operators and the ability to swith between them, it iscalled ALU - arithmetic logic unit.

The data is coming from:
 - registers (small, fast)
 - memory (large, slow)
 - outside world

Flip flop is the smallest memory element avalible.
