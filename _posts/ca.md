# Culture
Acording to Edgar Schein, culture consits of layers, like onion.

Layers (from outer to inner):
1. artefacts - visible physical manifestatinos of the culture
2. social norms and values - writen and unwriten desired behaviours
3. basic assumptions - axioms norms and values are drive from

There are many definitions of culture, for example: the way in which a group of people solve problems.

Culture is learned programming and unnatural.

We identify with many different groups on different levels.
Each is associated with one subculture we belong to.

## Communication

Communication is the exchange of meaning using the following steps:
 - encoding
 - transmition through a chanell
 - decoding
 - feedback (it is a loop)  
Our culture affects every single step, so intercultural communication introduces noise and
causes misunderstanding.

## Noise
1. external - caused by the environment
2. internal - emotions, biases
3. cultural - differences in encoding and decoding protocols

## TOPOI Model
There are 5 areas for potential misunderstanding:
1. tongue (language) - verbal / nonverbal
2. order - the world view
3. person - the releationship (symmetrical / complementary)
4. organization - way of doing things (social, profesional)
5. intention & influence - needs and motives
You can use this insight to find and resolve misunderstandings.
Ask the 3 key intervention questions:
1. What is my share in the misunderstanding?
2. What is the other person's share?
3. What is the influence of social norms and values?

## Global citizienship
Global citizenship is the sense of belonging to the global community.
Global citizenship comprises from these competencies:
 - empathy and repect for diversity
 - critical thinking
 - awearness of global issues (and thier connection to local ones)
 - social & communication skills
 - collaborative thinking

# McClelland's theory of needs
McClelland argues humans are mainly motivated by three needs - Power, Achivement,
Affiliation. 
Everyone wants all these things, but most people have a primary need.
We can group people based on their primary need and assign these groups characteristis.

Individuals motivated primary by their need for **achivement**:
 - desire to excell in what they do
 - like to set difficult goals and then meet them 
 - prefer to work in result-oriented environment 
 - want feedback on thier work
 - avoid low-risk low-reard (boring) and high-risk high-reward (random) situations
 - often prefer working alone
 
Individuals motivated primary by thier need for **power**:
 - desire to hold authority over others
 - driven by reputation
 - flourish in leadership positions
 - are self-disciplined
 - are willing to play zero-sum games

Individuals motivated primary by **affiliation**:
 - desire to be loved and accepted 
 - have strong relationships
 - flourish when working in group
 - avoid risk
 - fear being rejected
 - adhere to the norms 

You can use this knowledge to orginise temas more effectively by leveraing strengths and
weaknesses of your team members.
