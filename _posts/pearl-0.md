CS is about compuuters no more than astronomy is about telescopes.

	Computer is an electronic information processing machine which is controlled by a sequence of coded instrucitons.

Computers changed a lot over the years, but fundamentaly work the same. 

We will be working with arduinos.

Analog signals has (infinitely) many possilbe levels. Most real world quantities are analog - temperature, distance, time, voltage. 

Digital signal has limited number of levels, often 0/1, also low/high.
Small amount of distortion does no harm, so accuracy is easily preserved.

To interpret binary information we need to agree about encodings - ASCII, int, jpeg, mp3, etc.

You can write numbers in binary and other bases and convert between them. This ability will be tested.

There are multiple ways negative numbers are represented in binary. 

Computers are made of logical gates.
 - A and B $AB$
 - A or B $A + B$
 - not A $\overline{A}
 - $AB = BA$
 - $A+B = B+A$
 - $C (A + B) = CA + CB$
 - DeMorgan's theorem: $\overline{AB} = \overline{A} + \overline{B}$
 - $\overline{A}A = 0$
