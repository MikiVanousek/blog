# McClelland's theory of needs
McClelland argues humans are mainly motivated by three needs - Power, Achivement,
Affiliation. 
Everyone wants all these things, but most people have a primary need.
We can group people based on their primary need and assign these groups characteristis.

Individuals motivated primary by their need for **achivement**:
 - desire to excell in what they do
 - like to set difficult goals and then meet them 
 - prefer to work in result-oriented environment 
 - want feedback on thier work
 - avoid low-risk low-reard (boring) and high-risk high-reward (random) situations
 - often prefer working alone
 
Individuals motivated primary by thier need for **power**:
 - desire to hold authority over others
 - driven by reputation
 - flourish in leadership positions
 - are self-disciplined
 - are willing to play zero-sum games

Individuals motivated primary by **affiliation**:
 - desire to be loved and accepted 
 - have strong relationships
 - flourish when working in group
 - avoid risk
 - fear being rejected
 - adhere to the norms 

You can use this knowledge to orginise temas more effectively by leveraing strengths and
weaknesses of your team members.
